/* classes that can be used on multiple times
like center-text, margin-bottom-large etc.
If there is a component or block that is independent 
and can be used anywhere across the project, and if it 
needed a slightly different style like margin bottom which 
is unique on a specific page, then we apply that different 
style through utility classes to make component reusable.
